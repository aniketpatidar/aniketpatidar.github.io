## Who Am I?

<img src="/images/IMG_20230408_173432_928.jpg" alt="aniket-avatar" style="max-width:400px;"/>

My name is Aniket Patidar, and I'm a software engineer living in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

I enjoy writing. I started this blog as a way of motivating myself into making meaningful contributions.

Most of these writings are Ruby and Rails posts with a few smatterings of opinion with regard to developer life.

I really enjoy and love building websites and web-applications with Ruby and Rails. Every day, I try to learn something new in Ruby and Rails and write about it.

Join me for more chai-fueled content!
<!-- If you'd like to work with me, please send me an email. If you have a Rails app that you need to build/maintain/enhance, or build/migrate a website to Rails, get in touch. -->
